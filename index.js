//     army, and rose to the rank of commander. His father, Sadarichos, was a vizier during the reign of
//     Numarius, and his mother was the sister of Wasilides, the vizier. When King Normarius died in the
//     Persian war, and his son Justus was in the army fighting in the west. The two ministers, Sadarichos
//     and Basilides, continued to manage the affairs of the kingdom, until the pagan king of Diocletian in
//     the year 303 AD. The effects of persecution on Christians. As for St. Theodore, at this time, he
//     assumed the leadership of the army fighting against the Persians. And he saw in a night vision that
//     there was a ladder from earth to heaven, and above the ladder the Lord sat on a great pulpit and
//     around it were myriads of angels glorifying. Under the stairs, he saw a great dragon, Satan. And the
//     Lord said to Saint Theodore, Your blood will be shed on my name, so he said to him and my friend to
//     Lyondius? And the Lord said to him, it is not only him. And even the Persian Panicarus, and when a
//     truce was made between the Roman army and the Persian army, and he instructed him to the Christian
//     religion, he believed in Christ. Then Diocletian saw that Prince Theodore should be brought in, so
//     he brought his army with him to Lyndius and Panicarros, and if Theodore knew that the king would
//     invite him to worship idols, he said to his soldiers, whoever of you wanted to fight in the name of
//     the Lord Christ, let him stay with me. They all cried with one voice, We die with you, and your God
//     is our God. And when he reached the city, he left his soldiers outside, and entered the king who
//     welcomed him well. And he asked him about war with the courage of faith. I do not know a god to whom
//     I worship except my Lord Jesus Christ. Diocletian ordered the soldiers to nail him to a tree and to
//     intensify his torment, but the Lord was strengthening and comforting him. Finally, he surrendered
//     his pure soul to the hand of the Lord who loved him, and received the crown of eternal glory in the
//     kingdom of the heavens. Then the king sent priests of Apollon to the saintsâ€™ soldiers calling them
//     to worship idols. So they all cried, saying, We have no king but our Lord Jesus Christ, King of
//     kings and Lord of lords. When he heard Diocletian, he sent to cut off their heads all, and they
//     received luminous wreaths and everlasting happiness. May their prayers be with us, Amen.`
